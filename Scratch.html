                The first documented appearance of the expression "To give the shirt 
                off one's back", happened in 1771 as an idiom that indicates 
                extreme desperation or generosity and is still in common usage. 
                In 1827 Hannah Montague, a housewife in upstate New York, invents the detachable collar. 
                Tired of constantly washing her husband's entire shirt when only the collar needed it, 
                she cut off his collars and devised a way of attaching them to the neckband after washing. 
                It wasn't until the 1930s that collar stays became popular,
                although these early accessories resembled tie clips more than the 
                small collar stiffeners available today. They connected the collar points to the 
                necktie, keeping them in place

                The reason I first cared about shirts stemed from the question "How many holes does a shirt have?". The actual answer isn't as natural as one mught think.
                My roomates and I ended up talking about this question for multiple hours and multiple days. To any math professor, this would be a boring and 
                easily answered question, but for us, it opened up our world. How multiple holes entering into a shared space effects the total amound of holes.
                I'd like to thank shirts for introducing me to a whole new world. Pun Intended.
